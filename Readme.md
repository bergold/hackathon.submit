## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/Images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

The growing population is a big problem. Important resources like water are getting raw.
This web app illustrates this fast growth.
It displays the population of the last years in a great graph.
Select a year and the app calculates how much of the earth is populated in procent.
Change the value of Area/Human to adapt it to your calulations.
And last but not least, my favorite: Click the play button and animate through your selected range.
